# issue:



The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required by inkex.py and 
therefore this extension. Please download and install the latest version from 
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/lxml/, 
or install it through your package manager by a command like: 
sudo apt-get install python-lxml

Technical details:
No module named lxml

```
sudo pip install --upgrade lxml
```
