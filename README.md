<<<<<<< HEAD

Once you create a drawing, you can convert it easly in the terminal 
using the following commands!


```
inkscape --export-png drawing_v##.png drawing.svg
inkscape --export-pdf $(@) $(<)
inkscape -z -e drawing.png -w 1024 -h 1024 drawing.svg
``` 



=======
These are some images that I would like to preserve in
this repository. The creation of this repository might be a bit silly and perhaps
you it is such a waste of resources. I however like to think that is important
to have an inspiration wallpaper in your machine. Another reason for this repo
is that I am always migrating from different machines.

# TODO
- [ ] create a path tree in the readme for each of the files.
