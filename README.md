Image Repository
---

These are some images that I would like to preserve in 
this repository. It might be silly and perhaps a waste of resources, 
but I think it is good to have an inspiration wallpaper in your machine. 
It is also part of this idea of mine where everything is migrating
even the images of your desktop from machine to machine.
