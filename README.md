Image Repository
---

These are some images that I would like to preserve in
this repository. The creation of this repository might be a bit silly
(and perhaps you might think, it is such a waste of resources). I however would like 
to think that is important as important as to choose the right place to look at
where you might  have some sort of inspiration in a wallpaper of your machine. 
Another reason for this repo is that I am always migrating from different machines
and it is hard to remember where I saved those images that look outstanding 
and inspirational.
