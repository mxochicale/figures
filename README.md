Image Repository
---

These are some images that I would like to preserve in
this repository. The creation of this repository might be a bit silly and perhaps
you it is such a waste of resources. I however like to think that is important
to have an inspiration wallpaper in your machine. Another reason for this repo
is that I am always migrating from different machines.

# TODO
- [ ] create a path tree in the readme for each of the files.
