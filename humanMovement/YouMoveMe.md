You Move Me (an interface for human/machine collaboration)
Lara Greene
Steel, Wood, Fabric, Steel Cables.
(2005)

The piece is a life-size mechanical she-humanoid. Steel cables extend from
within the body to multi-functioning levers that can be pushed, pulled and
twisted to create various movements and affect her position in space. Complete
body articulation is possible, however for this a group of up to eight operators
is necessary, these being any visitors who wish to take part. A space in front
of the figure invites passers by to approach and engage in physical or verbal
communication.

This is a physically immediate, tactile and engaging experience. The work
experimentally hands over control to visitors but a shared portion of it
only. The figure has the capacity for elegance or awkwardness dependent upon
people's ability to control and desire to co-operate with each other. In a
society so focussed on individuality this piece highlights group dynamics and
uses it to fuel the outcome. Participants become performers or collaborators
creating a web of interplay which is as much part of the piece as the sculpture.

	After graduating in Fine Art from The Nottingham Trent University in
	'99, Lara jointly set up 'Reactor', an artist studios and collective
	producing events for the public which experiment with the audience,
	pushing the boundaries of how far an audience may expect to be involved
	in an art event/piece. It was in this environment that she started
	creating mechanical puppet/machines.

The puppet/machines are interactive sculptures which act as an expressive and
communicative link between people. They explore notions of control/dependency,
power/intimidation, mimicry, and group co-ordination/discord, challenging our
sense of independence in the world.

In Jan/Feb 05 she undertook a residency at Amorphic Robot Works, NY to develop
the artwork 'You move me'. Previously she has worked on several shows as a
sculpture technician with Amorphic Robot Works manufacturing inflatable elements
for large scale installation/performance pieces.

Lara lives and works in Edinburgh.
