> "It is for certain the principal organ of our soul and the instrument with which it 
executes formidable things: the soul believes that it has penetrated everything outside of itself, 
such that there is no limit to its knowledge; 
however, when the soul enters its own house, it would not know how to describe it, 
and it does not know itself anymore. 
One only has to dissect the big mass of matter that makes up 
the brain to have reason to lament this ignorance. 
On the surface, you see an admirable diversity, but when have entered it, you cannot see a thing.” 

Thus wrote the Danish polymath and later cleric Nicolaus Steno in his Discours sur l’Anatomie du Cerveau in 1669.
